# Learning of physical-layer communication with quantized feedback. 
This code demonstrates how to perform learning of a communication system over a binary feedback channel. 

## Usage
The code has comprises 6 python notebooks:
* Fiber_Optical_learning_with_quantized_feedback.py: alternating training with quantized feedback
* Fiber_Optical_perfect_feedback.py: alternating training with perfect feedback
* Fiber_Optical_SER_no_quantization.py: compute SER when feedback are preprocessed, while not quantized
* Fiber_Optical_SER_one_bit_quantization.py: compute SER when feedback are preprocessed, and quantized with 1 bit
* Fiber_Optical_SER_vs_bits_flipping.py: compute SER when the quantization are flipped with probability p
* Fiber_SER_vs_quantization_bits.py: Compute SER when n bits are used for quantization

We recommend to start with the first notebook, which will determine a transmitter and a receiver for a optical nonlinear communication channel. The code has the following parameters:
```
M = 16                # number of points in the constellation
P_in_dBm = -5         # transmit power in dBm
gamma = 1.27          # fiber non-linearity parameter (set to zero for an AWGN channel)
L = 2000              # total link length in km
K = 20                # number of segments
P_noise_dBm = -21.3   # noise power per segment in dBm
sigma_pi = np.sqrt(0.0005)  # Variance for Gaussian policy (before scaling with the transmit power)
num_bits = 1          # number of bits used for quantization
```
